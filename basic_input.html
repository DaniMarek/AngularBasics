		<p>Name : <input type="text" ng-model="name" placeholder="Enter name here"></p>
		<h1>Hello, {{name}}</h1>
		<h3>Pretty cool, right?</h3>
		<p>Using the Google API (application programming interface) and AJAX, the angular model is created live as the client enters it. This is basically how front-end frameworks work; they take info from the client and validate/ save data from inputs right then and there, rather than sending inputs to the back end for validation. This makes everything faster (and cooler) and leads to a better user experience.</p>
		<p>In this instance, no database is being utilized. The ng-model, "name" is called directly below the input box</p>
